Exercises from The Go Programming Language and other Go programs

My plan to get bootstrapped in Golang:

  * [ ] Five exercises from Chatper 1 (Tutorial)
  * [ ] Five exercises from Chatper 2 (Program Structure)
  * [ ] Five exercises from Chatper 3 (Basic Data Types)
  * [ ] Five exercises from Chatper 4 (Composite Types)
  * [ ] Five exercises from Chatper 5 (Functions)
  * [ ] All exercises from Chapter 10 (Packages and the Go Tool)
  * [ ] All exercises from Chapter 11 (Testing)
  
My reasoning for this plan: I need to quickly get up to speed on basic language
syntax and constructs in order to actually know how to write Go code. I also
need to know what the `go` tool can do, and how to write tests for it.
